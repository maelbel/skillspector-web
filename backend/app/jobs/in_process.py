"""Scans run as asyncio tasks in the API process: the self-hosted default.

The queue lives in the database, so a restart loses nothing. A scan is `pending` until it starts,
and goes back to `pending` when the API stops mid-scan (scanner.run_job). On startup the runner
picks every pending or running scan back up, oldest first, with its upload and, for AI review, its
credentials: the user's saved key, the server's Claude login, or the one-off key and endpoint held
encrypted for it (scan_secrets, which needs SKILLSPECTOR_WEB_SECRET_KEY). A scan started
MAX_ATTEMPTS times without finishing fails, saying so, rather than running forever.

One API process runs the queue: replicas would each pick up the others' scans.
