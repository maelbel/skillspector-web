"""A shared result, read-only, for anyone with its link: no sign-in, with accounts or without.

A scan's owner (or an admin) shares it from its result page (POST /scan/{id}/share), and the link
works until they revoke it. A shared result leaves out what belongs to their account: how many AI
tokens it used, the comparison with their previous scan of the target, and what they could do with
it (rescan, share). Each address may open a limited number of shared pages a minute, which keeps
anyone from trying tokens, though at 192 random bits there's nothing to find.
