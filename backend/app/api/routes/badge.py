"""A target's status badge: the verdict of the latest scan of it that its owner put on the badge.

A scan's owner puts a shared result on its target's badge from the share dialog (POST
/scan/{id}/badge); revoking the link takes it off. Nothing else feeds a badge: a private scan, or
one only shared by link, never shows. Nor does a scan with a baseline, whose accepted findings
don't count, or an upload, which has no link. The web app renders the SVG (server/routes/badge.get.ts)
and caches it; this lookup is one indexed query, and never starts a scan.
