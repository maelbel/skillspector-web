"""Run one skillspector scan and report on stdout, one tagged JSON event per line.

This file is uploaded into a Vercel Sandbox and run there with
``python3 sandbox_runner.py <target> [--llm] [--baseline FILE] [--yara-rules-dir DIR]
[--transitive-depth N [--transitive-allow PREFIX]... [--transitive-deny PREFIX]...]`` (``--llm``
adds skillspector's AI review; ``--baseline`` suppresses the findings a baseline accepts;
``--yara-rules-dir`` loads extra YARA rules; ``--transitive-depth`` follows the skill's external
references and scans them too), so it must stay standalone: the
standard library and skillspector only, nothing from ``app``. The API's own scans reuse its
baseline helpers.

Events, each on its own line after PREFIX:
- ``{"event": "start", "skillspector_version": "..."}``
- ``{"event": "step", "node": "..."}``: a graph node finished
- ``{"event": "log", "line": "INFO ..."}``: a skillspector log record
- ``{"event": "report", "report": {...}}``: the finished report, exit code 0. Its
  ``generated_baseline`` holds a baseline accepting every active finding, when one could be made.
  For a repository holding several skills, ``skills`` lists each skill's own report
  (see run_scan)
- ``{"event": "error", "message": "..."}``: the scan failed, exit code 1
