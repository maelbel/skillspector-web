"""skillspector's own analysis settings, set by operators for every scan.

skillspector reads these from its environment. Only the ones listed in SKILLSPECTOR_ENV are passed
on, from SKILLSPECTOR_WEB_* settings, never the API's whole environment: a sandboxed scan gets them
as its VM's environment (app/sandbox_executor.py), and a local scan from this process's, set by
apply_to_process before skillspector is imported, because it reads some of them only then.
Extra YARA rules aren't an environment variable: each scan is handed the directory instead.
