"""Scan targets as skillspector should fetch them.

A code host's file link (GitHub's /blob/) is a web page around the file. skillspector downloads it
as a direct file, so without a rewrite it scans the page's HTML instead of the skill. Each link
here becomes the host's raw download of the same file, at the same ref and path.

An MCP server is scanned by its entry in the MCP Registry, named or linked: either becomes the
registry API's URL for that entry, which app/sandbox_runner.py recognises.
